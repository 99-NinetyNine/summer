#### Technical Approach
```python
# Eye Tracking Integration
class GazeTrackingSystem:
    def __init__(self):
        self.pupil_tracker = PupilTracker()
        self.attention_model = AttentionMechanism()
    
    def track_user_focus(self, screen_region):
        # Track where human looks during CAPTCHA solving
        gaze_data = self.pupil_tracker.get_gaze_coordinates()
        attention_map = self.attention_model.generate_attention(gaze_data)
        return attention_map
    
    def apply_human_attention(self, screenshot, attention_map):
        # Focus AI model on same regions human focuses on
        focused_region = self.extract_focused_region(screenshot, attention_map)
        return focused_region
```

#### Implementation Strategy
1. **Calibration Canvas**: Create gaze tracking calibration system
2. **Real-time Tracking**: Monitor user eye movements during interactions
3. **Attention Learning**: Train AI to focus on same regions as humans
4. **CAPTCHA Solving**: Apply attention mechanisms to solve CAPTCHAs

#### Security & Ethics Considerations
