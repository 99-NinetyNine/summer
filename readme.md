## Intuition
Filling job applications, google forms, electricity bills, or any day-to-day activity in our life is very boring.

And on an average one task might take minimum 1 minute. If we have 100 such repeated task, and filling job application these days 
require even more attempts. So it is boring, costs time, drains energy, distracts and so on.

## Solution
For above problem, Claude, OpenAI had lauched their system as I found called as Claude Computer and GPT-4V.


## My Approach
It involves just learning one task, simple task, make model data from scratch.

I think I can train such a simple model on my pc as well.


## Let's GO.
